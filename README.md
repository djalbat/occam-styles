## Introduction

This package contains colour definitions together with user interface and syntax schemes. It also contains various images, in either native or JSX form. A distribution of [FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) is also included.

There is a small example application to view the images in JSX form.

## Installation

With [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

    npm install occam-styles

You can also clone the repository with [Git](https://git-scm.com/)...

    git clone https://github.com/djalbat/occam-styles.git

...and then install the dependencies with npm from within the project's root directory:

    npm install

You can also run a development server, see the section on building later on.

## Building

Automation is done with [npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts), have a look at the `package.json` file. The pertinent commands are:

    npm run build-debug
    npm run watch-debug

You can also start a small development server:

    npm start

The example will then be available at http://localhost:8888 and will reload automatically when changes are made.
