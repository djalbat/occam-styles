## Introduction

This package contains colour definitions together with user interface and syntax schemes. It also contains the Occam logo, both as a conventional and a JavaScript SVG. A distribution of [FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) is also included.

## Acknowledgements

* The syntax colouring is based on the [Monokai](http://www.monokai.nl/blog/wp-content/asdev/Monokai.tmTheme) theme.

* Colours are courtesy of Chirag Mehta's [Name that Colour](http://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color/).

* The logo was converted to SVG format with Peter Selinger's [Potrace](http://potrace.sourceforge.net/).
